### Ansible inventory file ###

# "ansible_host": Update the value of this key with the outcome of the  "docker-machine ip ansible-vault" run on your Windows Docker host.
#
# "ansible_ssh_private_key_file": Leave this property unchanged since the id_rsa file will be provided as part of a Docker volume.
# Docker Machine setups SSH using user "docker" and a private key located here: "C:\Users\<USER_WITH_ADMIN_RIGHTS>\.docker\.machine\machines\ansible-vault\id_rsa", 
# where <USER_WITH_ADMIN_RIGHTS> represents the user with administrator rights who has created the VM in the first place.
#
# "ansible_python_interpreter": On Tiny Linux, the path to Python binary is not the expected "/usr/bin/python", so we need to set it explicitly to "/usr/local/bin/python".
